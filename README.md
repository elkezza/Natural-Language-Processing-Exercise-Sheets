# NLTK Book Exercise Sheets

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for exercise sheets based on the "Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)" book, a popular guide for learning and applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Python.

## Overview of Exercise Sheets

Each notebook corresponds to an exercise sheet focusing on different aspects of NLP, demonstrating practical applications and exercises for mastering the NLTK framework.

### [Exercise Sheet 1](Exercise_Sheet_1.ipynb)
**Summary:** Introduces basic NLP concepts using NLTK, including word counts and lexical diversity calculations.

### [Exercise Sheet 3](Exercise_Sheet_3.ipynb)
**Summary:** Focuses on improving Python code efficiency by rewriting loops as list comprehensions, with applications in NLP tasks.

### [Exercise Sheet 5](Exercise_Sheet_5.ipynb)
**Summary:** Explores the Brown corpus in NLTK, teaching how to sort and understand both original and universal part-of-speech tags.

### [Exercise Sheet 6](Exercise_Sheet_6.ipynb)
**Summary:** Involves building a name gender classifier using the Names Corpus in NLTK, covering feature extraction, Naive Bayes Classifier application, and model evaluation.
